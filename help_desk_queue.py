Memo: 
For this weekâ€™s assignment we learned what stacks, queues, and 
when to use a stack or a queue. A stack is a linear data that 
follows a last in, first out order. The last value added is the 
first one removed. Now for, is the queues, queues is a linear data 
structure that follows a first in, first out order. In a queue, 
the first value added is the first one removed. Now that stacks 
and queues have been explained, it is time to explain when to 
use them. Stacks are used when the most recent action should be 
handled first. On the other hand, queues are used when the first 
request should be handled first. Stacks are effective for this type 
of assignment with us doing undo/ redo systems because it aligns better 
with this type of coding. And for queues, it is better used for help
 desk ticketing, it is the best thing to be able to take the costumers 
 requests for a help desk scenario. For this assignment, building this 
 code by using the stacks and queues using linked nodes, along with the 
 pop and push, as well as the enqueue, it will make the performance run a lot smoother.
